-=- What is the HackThisSite Mirror? -=-

HackThisSite may from time to time mirror things we think are deserving of our
bandwidth and maintenance, simply because of a belief in the cause or a general
liking of the data and its producers.


-=- Will you mirror my data? -=-

You are more than welcome to request mirroring by emailing us at
admin - at - hackthissite - dot - org, but we will NOT guarantee anything!
Our bandwidth and time is precious, and just because you think your data is
well-deserving of our attention, does not mean we will think the same.


-=- What do you generally mirror? -=-

HackThisSite will mirror projects we are involved with, or have a vested
interest in.  For example, we are affiliated with Hackbloc, which produces
the HackThisZine periodical.  Due to this, we mirror their publications.
Other such examples could someday include FreeBSD, nginx, Asterisk, UnrealIRC,
among others, since these are all projects whose benefits we reap.


-=- What are your mirror specifications? -=-

mirror.hackthissite.org is hosted on a dedicated server in Europe with
redundant drives and a 1 Gbps connection.
