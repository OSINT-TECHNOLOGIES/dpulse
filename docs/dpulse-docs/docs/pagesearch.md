# PageSearch mode

PageSearch is an additional extended subdomains deep search function, which starts in addition to basic scan. User can choose whether to use PageSearch or not during pre-scan preparation steps.

## PageSearch results

PageSearch returns extended information about found subdomains during basic scan. Extended information contains following:

1. More e-mail addresses
2. API keys
3. Exposed passwords
4. Cookies
5. Hidden forms of data and other web page elements
6. Documents, config files, databases files (and PageSearch can download them!)
7. Specified words by user in PDF files

PageSearch scan example (this example is not so representative because scanned site is not an example of real domain):
