## About DPULSE

DPULSE is a software solution for conducting OSINT research in relation to a certain domain. Using this software you can extract useful information such as:
1. WHOIS information 
2. Subdomains
3. Mentions of the domain's owner organization in some social networks, as well as organization profiles in social networks.
4. IP addresses
5. Public documents
6. Domain-related Google queries
7. InternetDB search results (possible vulnerabilities, open ports and so on)
8. Used web-technologies
9. Sitemap, robots.txt files, SSL certificate info
    
All these results are compiled into an easy-to-read PDF report by category.
